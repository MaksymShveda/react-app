It does not sport the sleekest design or coolest abilities but it is quick and nimble. The Empire is built on the back of the TIE Fighter and it continues to improve and be reinvented all throughout Star Wars. The TIE has no landing gear, but some versions allow the wings to fold in on themselves as they come in to land.",

With its shields and fast maneuverability, it quickly began to dominate space as the superior fighter between the Rebels and the Empire. It was then further used by the New Republic and Resistance fighters. Its four blaster cannons and torpedoes make it a terror to go up against, but its design is purely for function.",

Designed so it can fly upright or on its side, the B-Wing's T-shape hull allows for a very powerful laser blast, and some can even disable large Star Destroyers. Its gyroscopic cockpit allows the pilot to stay upright regardless of what angle they need to fly at. The B-Wing was instrumental in the Rebellion's success against Imperial blockades.",

Its design is very interesting since it was made to be a ramming vessel, as seen in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. The oversized front of the ship is made to dig into its target and push it along, as well as be extremely durable. The Hammerhead Corvette made its first in-canon appearance in Star Wars: Rebels.",

Its wings are moveable and fold out to form a V-shape when travelling, but when coming into land or skim over the ground they fold back in, forming its classic U-shape. The functionality of the ship is great and the design is very cool and interestingâ€” hopefully a similar ship will pop up in Patty Jenkins' Rogue Squadron.",

It also helps that it has one of the best pilots at the helm, Hera Syndulla. It also has a second smaller ship, the Phantom, that can detach from the main hull.

On top of that is has a roomy cargo hold with plenty of space for those unfortunate enough to end up in its onboard carbonate freezing chamber. Much to the fans' dismay, the Razor Crest is no more since it was blow up by Moff Gideon in a recent episode of The Mandalorian.",

It is outfitted with numerous special weapons the best being a seismic charge, like what was seen in the most recent episode of The Mandalorian. The Slave 1 has great maneuverability and its cockpit rotates which allows the pilot to always be upright. It is as intimidating as it is practical.",
